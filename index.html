  <p>I am a data-driven engineer who creates technical solutions to real world problems through software. 
  I assess the fundamental principles behind problems to develop modular, scalable, and robust solutions through experimentation and iteration.

  <h2 id="Research">Research</h2>
  <p>Discovering new phyics using the principles of science and engineering</p>
  <p>I spent 2 years working in the <a href="http://osksn2.hep.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/index_eng.html">Yamanaka Lab</a> at Osaka University working on the KOTO experiment. Here we use a high intensity proton beam to generate neutral Kaon and measure their decay. 
  Since these kaons only exist for around half a nanosecond and we are trying to measure a decay that only exists one in 33 billionth of the time, it's necessary to have a fast, accurate, and robust measurement system. </p>
  
  <h3><strong>Charged Particle Detector Development</strong></h3>
  <p>The high enery proton beam produces not only neutral kaons, but also a variety of other particles whose signature can mimic kaons, necessitating accurate detection of incoming particles.
    I <strong>led the development of</strong> one such detector that was used for incoming charged particles. I was in charge of researching and testing the materials, creating a mechanical and electronic design, running small scale tests for feasability, directing a full scale development, writing backend data acquisition and frontend monitor software, testing, installation, and performance analysis and optimization.
    This consisted of lots of development in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> using the <a href="https://root.cern/">ROOT</a> framework as well as work with data pipelines and storage in a <strong>linux</strong> environment. It also consisted of being a strong leader and collaborating in a team with many intelligent reasearchers.
    If you are interested please read my <a href="documents/Taylor_Nunes_Thesis.pdf">thesis</a>.</p>
  <h3><strong>Additional reasearch</strong></h3>
  <p>In addition, I conducted research in developing algorithms to improve data analysis. I developed algorithms for event by event noise classification. I processed digital waveforms for separation of overlapping peaks. </p>
  
  <h3><strong>Conferences</strong></h3>
  <p>In addition to weekly presentations and giving colloquiums on different papers, I participated in the following conferences:</p>
  <p><strong>T. C. Nunes</strong>, "Analysis of Waveforms in the KOTO Experiment at J-PARC", presented at The Physical Society of Japan 2020 Autumn Meeting.
  </p>
  <p><strong>T. C. Nunes</strong>, "Design and Performance Evaluation of a Low-Mass
      In-Beam Charged Particle Detector for the KOTO Experiment at J-PARC", presented at The Physical Society of Japan 2021 Annual Meeting.
