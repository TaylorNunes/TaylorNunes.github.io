{: id="About"}

I am a data-driven engineer who creates technical solutions to real world problems through software. 
I assess the fundamental principles behind problems to develop modular, scalable, and robust solutions through experimentation and iteration.

I spent 2 years working on the KOTO experiment. Here we use a high intensity proton beam to generate neutral Kaon and measure their decay. 

#### Charged Particle Detector Development
The high enery proton beam at KOTO produces a variety of background particles that mimic the kaons we want to detect. In order to differentiate these particles, I led the development of a particle detector to measure incoming charged particles. I ran Monte Carlo simulations for different designs to fit the data aquisition capabilities for our system. After the detector was built, I developed back-end data acquisition software to analyze the signal and save the useful data. After deployment, I developed front-end software to monitor its performance, integrating it's health and functionality with the rest of the system. After analyzing the data collected with the new detector I determined we were able to increase the experiment sensitivity by a factor of 20. Data aquisiton software was mainly developed in C++ in a linux environment. Monitor software was developed with a mix of C++, Python, Bash, and HTML. Analysis was done with C++ and python. The work was highly collaborative and consisted of weekly discussions with PhDs and researchers from multiple different countries.
